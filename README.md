# Topological-multi-mode-waveguide-QED

In this repository, you have access to the code used for the paper 'Topological multi-mode waveguide QED', by Carlos Vega, Diego Porras, 
and Alejandro Gonz√°lez-Tudela. The repository contains the several files:

1. use-functions.py: Python script where the main functions used in the work are implemented. 

2. Photonic_Bath_Features.ipynb: Jupyter notebook where we compute several quantites regarding the Harper-Hofstadter as a photonic bath,
                                 focusing on its eigenstates features at the lattice boundary.
                                 
3. Light_matter_interactions_Edge_HH_Lattice.ipynb: Jupyter notebook where we couple a quantum emitter to the edge of a Harper-Hofstadter lattice
                                 and simulate spontaneous emission dynamics and mode-selectivity with engineered non-local couplings.
